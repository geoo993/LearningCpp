	//there's another way of instantiating another object from a class

	Game *pGame = new Game();// the new operator allocates memory explicitly, memory which you actually manage your self. in this case its allocating memory for a single (game) object. the round brackets () are optional so you can put them in or not put them in, maybe unless you want to add parameters in brackets
	//Game *pGame = new Game;// same as above without round brackets

	(*pGame).setTitle("Doom");
	(*pGame).print();

	Game *pNewGame = new Game;
	pNewGame->setTitle("Resident Evil 7");// adding the arrow now makes the memory for this new object to not be destroyed/destructed by the destructor. you have to call delete to make sure that the destructor happens
	pNewGame->print();

	delete pNewGame;
