	int *pnValue = &nValue;// you can create a variable that stores the address of variables like the nValue int for example, to do that you create an int pointer (int*) that takes the address of the variable in this case the nValue int
	// here we are saying here pointer (int *) to an int (pnValue) equals to the address of nValue
	//pnValue stored the address of the nValue int.
	//pnValue is essentially the memory location of the nValue int

	// you can also dereference the pointer and to do that you just type in * in from of the pointer variable and this will give th value that the pointer refers to
	cout << "Int value via Pointer: " << *pnValue << endl;
