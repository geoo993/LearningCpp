Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney is "going nowhere", according to manager Jose Mourinho.
"[Rooney] is a top player, a very important player for us," added Mourinho. 
"He is going nowhere - we like him, he likes us. 
He's not happy because he's been on the bench but he is even unhappier when he's injured."
