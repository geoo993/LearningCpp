//function pointers have been around for a long time
//in c++ 11, you can use lambda expressions as alternative to function pointers
//same way you can declare pointer to a variable, you can also do the same for functions, so you can actually pass a block of code to another function
//the virtual keyword is an example of an already created function, the virtual keyword is an instruction to call c++ to create a v table (virtual table), which is a table of function pointers
// virtual key word sends the instruction or call to the parent class function type, so when you call a method from a child class that uses virtual or via pointer to the parent call type, c++ can do a look up on table of functions pointer and find the right appropriate function to call

	// when we create the type of the variable of the actual pointer to a function, we are not going to need a function name in there
	// we are just going to need a pointer, something that points to the function
	// in the case of void return type like the test function above, which takes no parameters, we will need to use the return type of it to create the function pointer
	// so its a void type function with no parameters
	void (*pTest)();//this is now a variable called pTests which is a pointer to a function, that has no parameters

	//now we use the variable function pointer to point to the desired function
	pTest = &test;//here we are pointing to the test() function (pointing by getting the address)
	//(*pTest)();//now we are pointing and calling the function, so we are calling function test via pointer function to it called pTest

	pTest();//we do not really need the * to point to it, or the brackets, we call just call it like this as well


	//to make things simple, we can also pointing to the function when we are initialising the variable

	cout << count_if(tests.begin(), tests.end(), match) << endl;// this will give a summary of how many times the bool true, meaning it will give the result of how many times the match function is true


	//in the case where you want to do the similar thing like count_if, where you want to pass in a block of code.
