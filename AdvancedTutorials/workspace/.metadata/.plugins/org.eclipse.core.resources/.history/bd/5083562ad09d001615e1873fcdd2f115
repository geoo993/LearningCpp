// how to write a struct in a binary file

//the only difference between a struct and a class is that the members of a struct are public by default
//structs are mostly used to write into files
struct Person{

	//when trying to store for example a text, that text is not directly stored in this variable
	//when we declare variables in c++, they are stored in an area of memory known as a stack, this is a relatively small area of memory thats used for storing variables or for keeping track of function calls.
	//we cannot use string because it allocates extra memory to store the actual text
	string name;
